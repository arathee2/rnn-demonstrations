# rnn-demonstrations
Demonstration of some of the most popular use cases of recurrent neural networks.

The repository contains four notebooks.
1. pos-tagging.ipynb: This notebook demonstrates the use of RNN on a pos tagging task. (Test set accuracy: 99.4%)
2. char_level_rnn_code_generation: This notebook tries to build a character level text generator using RNN. The RNN was trained on the linux-kernel c code.
3. word_level_rnn_ramayana: This notebook shows how can one use an RNN to build a word level text generator. The RNN was trained on the corpus of the text of Ramayana by Valmiki.
4. predict_dow_jones_with_news: This notebook demonstrates how can you predict the next day's stock market opening price using the previous days' news.

All the data sources that are used have been provided in the notebooks.
